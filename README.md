## Installation
Download infected.gsc and put it in your Plutonium T6 scripts folder

```%localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\t6\scripts\zm\```

(if the folder isnt there create them)


OR you may use the source code/uncompiled version by using starterweapongrab_sourcecode.gsc but if you don't know what youre doing in terms of GSC, I highly recommend you use the first choice
